### 1.
A class is the abstract representation of a generic thing in the real world.
They are templates for creating objects. They define the structure and behaviour of the objects that belong to them.
An object is an instance of a class, or the representation of one actual thing in the real world.
An object has a certain state and behaviour. 
The state of an object is defined by the values stored in the object's attributes; its behaviour by the implementation of its methods.
An attribute is a variable stored in an object. An attribute is a field in the object where data is stored.
Attributes represent properties of the object.
A method is one of the possible behaviours of an object.
In other words a method is an action, a function or a procedure an object can perform.
